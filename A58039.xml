            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Winding-Å¿heet in a Rumpled Wave. Nor is this all their danger, the Springing of a Plank, a Leak not to be found, nor Å¿uddenly Å¿topped, Running on a Shoal, or the Falling of a Water-Å¿pout, frequently carry with them the Å¿ame Inevitable Fate, and often makes them at their Wits Ends before they end their Lives; for, a certain ProÅ¿pect of <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Death muÅ¿t needs be Terrible to FleÅ¿h and Blood, and, in a great meaÅ¿ure, remove that ConÅ¿tant PreÅ¿ence of Mind that Å¿hould Å¿upport their Spirits amidÅ¿t all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: From this there is no way to Å¿ecure themÅ¿elves, but by laying hold on him that is Mighty, and able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t, on God, who is a preÅ¿ent help at need, whoÅ¿e eyes are in all places, in Heaven and Earth, and in the Great Deep; and thoÅ¿e that Cry to him in their DiÅ¿treÅ¿s, he will Å¿urely hear them and Deliver them out of all their Troubles, if they are Å¿incere in heart, and walk uprightly with him. For a Praying-</hi>Paul's <hi>Å¿ake, we find, though the Ship was broken, and periÅ¿hed on a Rock on the CoaÅ¿t of the IÅ¿land, antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Melita, <hi>now called</hi> Malta, <hi>all that were in it were Å¿aved, when they expected nothing leÅ¿s than to be Å¿wallowed up in that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ocean, as we find it in the</hi> Acts, <hi>Chap. 27.

               <hi>This</hi> Collection <hi>is taken moÅ¿tly from the Mouths of thoÅ¿e who have experienc'd God's Mercy this way, and whoÅ¿e Dangers have been as great as any could be on this Å¿ide the Grave; yet God, in his Mercy, delivered them out of all. The reÅ¿t are taken from Å¿uch Reverend</hi> Authors, <hi>that their Credit and Integrity is IndiÅ¿putable, being purpoÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Written to raiÅ¿e the Minds of Men to Contemplate and Adore the Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the All-wiÅ¿e Creator of the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niverÅ¿e, and may indifferently Å¿erve to this end as well at</hi> Land <hi>as</hi> Sea, <hi>though chiefly intended for</hi> Sea-faring <hi>Men, to put them in Mind, when they Read it, of their Danger, and what they may expect in their Danger, from the Death they apprehend in it, if they apply their hearts to true WiÅ¿dom. When all help or hopes fail, or Å¿eem to be at a loÅ¿s, then fix your hearts and eyes Å¿tedfaÅ¿tly on him who is

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38362:6"/>
grow, when Bread, the Staffe of life faileth! now Hunger becomes more dreadfull to them, then the every moment threatning Billows of the devouring Ocean; and they that one while feared drowning, now fears Starving; they are brought to the laÅ¿t meal in the Barrel, and the laÅ¿t oyl in the CruÅ¿e, and Å¿ay as Å¿he did <hi>We will Eat this little that is left, and dye:</hi> and now when they thought they had eaten the laÅ¿t, what conflicts muÅ¿t they needs have within themÅ¿elves? who knew not where to have another morÅ¿el to fortify the tyred and Å¿pent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with the conÅ¿tant toyl, and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: how they look one upon another, as men already under a Sentence of death; and by one anothers looks, Strike terror to one anothers Hearts; They look on every Å¿ide, PÅ¿al. 142. 4, 5. (as <hi>David</hi> Å¿ays) <hi>I looked on my right hand, but there was no man that would know me; Refuge failed me;</hi> or periÅ¿hed from me. They look downward, and Å¿ee nothing but the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of deÅ¿truction opening for them; they look upward, the onely, and laÅ¿t refuge, and remedy, in this deplorable eÅ¿tate was, out of the depths, they cry'd to the Lord,</p>
            <p>But though they look out of the Ship, as <hi>Noah</hi> did out of his Ark, upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

and Å¿end forth the Dove of Prayer, that winged MeÅ¿Å¿enger, to Heaven, yet Å¿he brings no Olive branch, no AnÅ¿wer; the waters aÅ¿Å¿wage not, the winds calm not, they are like the Prophets Servant, when he bid him 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 43. <hi>go up now; and look to-wards the Sea, and he went up and looked and Å¿aid, there is nothing;</hi> and this Å¿trikes them into dolefull and diÅ¿mall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; out of which Lamentations, at laÅ¿t Springs up a tragical and Å¿orrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Motion. The Motion is, that which the Marriners, in <hi>Jonahs</hi> VeÅ¿Å¿el, put in execution, <hi>Come let us caÅ¿t Lots, &amp;c.</hi> only with this difference, they caÅ¿t Lots to find out the dilinquent; and theÅ¿e, which of them Å¿hould dye firÅ¿t, to be a Sacrifice for ravenous Hunger to feed upon: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, as he in that caÅ¿e, <hi>John.</hi> 11. 50. <hi>It is expedient for us that one man Å¿hould dye for the People, and that the whole Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany periÅ¿h not.</hi> Life being Å¿weet, Skin for Skin, and all a man hath will he give for his life, they at laÅ¿t bring it, through many a Å¿ad debate, to a reÅ¿ult, they caÅ¿t the Lott, the diÅ¿poÅ¿ing of which is of the Lord; one of the Company is arreÅ¿ted by the Lott; here is the Condemned PriÅ¿oner: O but where is the Executioner to be found to act his office upon a poor Innocent? is it not

death to them now, to think who Å¿hall act this bloody part in the Tragedy? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall upon their involuntary Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Major <hi>Gibbons</hi> calls them to Prayer, conÅ¿idering, that in the Mount, the Lord is often Å¿een, and that many times our extremity proves Gods opportunity; he alÅ¿o askes the poor man if he was willing to dye; but O what a hard QueÅ¿tion is that to AnÅ¿wer!

Then he encouraged them to make another Attempt to faÅ¿ten the Rudder, without which they could not poÅ¿Å¿ible make towards any point for Å¿hore.

great relief, by cauÅ¿ing Å¿ome flying FiÅ¿h to fall into the Boat, which they eat raw, and were unto them more acceptable than the greateÅ¿t rarities and dainties at another time; God's Providence now proving the Caterer, they catch'd a Shark, and that Ravenous FiÅ¿h that uÅ¿es to prey upon men, now becomes a prey to theÅ¿e poor diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed Creatures; but they were glad of food in the want of fire, and have an heat in their Stomacks, to eat that raw, and digeÅ¿t at this time what would have made them Å¿ick at other times; but alas, another want they had, was drink as well as fire, but they were forced to open the belly of this Shark, and Å¿uck his blood for drink; at laÅ¿t, that God who hath a deÅ¿ire to the work of his own hands, gives them hopes to releaÅ¿e them out of this inÅ¿upportable miÅ¿ery, by letting them come to a diÅ¿covery of Land in the <hi>WeÅ¿t-Indies;</hi> but alas, they were Å¿o weak, that when they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hore, one or two of them dyed; but moÅ¿t of them lived to declare the works of the Lord.

any that would adventure their lives in Å¿o hazardous an undertaking: They had heard alÅ¿o, that the Company of <hi>MoÅ¿covy</hi> Merchants had once procur'd the <hi>Reprieve</hi> of Å¿ome Malefactors condemned to death here in <hi>England,</hi> unto whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ed Pardon, together with Rewards and ProviÅ¿ion of Cloaths, Victuals, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther NeceÅ¿Å¿aries, if they would Å¿tay one Winter there: But when they came thither and took a view of the deÅ¿olateneÅ¿s of the place, they conceiv'd Å¿uch horrour and fear in their hearts, that they choÅ¿e rather to return for <hi>England,</hi> and there to Å¿atisfie the Law with the loÅ¿s of their lives, than to Å¿tay in Å¿o deÅ¿olate and darkÅ¿om a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They remembred alÅ¿o a more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example, of Nine Good and Able Men left there formerly by the Å¿ame MaÅ¿ter that had now left them, who all died mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erably upon the place; and whoÅ¿e bodies were fearfully disfigured by the Savage Bears, and Hungry Foxes, which are the only Inhabitants of that comfortleÅ¿s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: All which made them, like amazed Men, to Å¿tand one looking upon another, every one fore-Å¿eeing the future Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of himÅ¿elf and of his Fellows: and that which much encreaÅ¿ed their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was, their want of all neceÅ¿Å¿ary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion

for the life of Man, having neither Cloaths to keep them warm, and for Å¿hift, or food to prevent the MiÅ¿eries of cruel Famine, nor a houÅ¿e wherein to Å¿hroud themÅ¿elves from the extremity of Cold.</p>
               <p>But after a Å¿pace, knowing that delay in extremities is the Mother of all danger, they began to conceive hope out of the depth of deÅ¿pair; and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ulted together of the likelieÅ¿t courÅ¿e for their preÅ¿ervation in that place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved upon the opportunity of the next fair weather to go to <hi>Green-Harbour</hi> to kill Å¿ome VeniÅ¿on for part of their winter ProviÅ¿ion, which accordingly ther did, but found not Å¿o many Deer as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; yet the firÅ¿t day they killed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Four Bears to boot, which they alÅ¿o intended to eat: The next day they killed Six Deer more, and as they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they killed Six more, and then the weather proving foul and cold, they laded their Shallop with the Dear and Bears; and finding another Shallop left there as uÅ¿ually they do from year to year, they laded it with Graves of Whales that had been boiled there that year; and Å¿o divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themÅ¿elves into thoÅ¿e two Shallops, they took the firÅ¿t opportunity of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bell-Sound</hi> to their Tent, where they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38362:38"/>
intended to take up their reÅ¿t for the Winter.</p>
               <p>But in their paÅ¿Å¿age, the night coming on, and the wind blowing hard, they were forc'd to Å¿tay in the midÅ¿t way at <hi>Bottel Cove</hi> for that night: There they faÅ¿ten'd their Shallops one to another, and caÅ¿ting out their Anchor, they left them riding in the <hi>Cove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here again, for the tryal of their patience, and to teach them to relie more upon God's Providence, than upon any outward means of their own, this miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance befel them: The wind blowing hard into the Cove, and their Anchor coming home, their Shallop Å¿unk into the Sea, and Å¿o wet all their ProviÅ¿ion, and Å¿ome of it they found Å¿wimming up and down by the Å¿hoar: The Å¿ight thereof, wonderfully troubled them, to Å¿ee the beÅ¿t part of their ProviÅ¿ion, the only hope of their lives under God, in danger either utterly to be loÅ¿t, or to be Å¿poil'd by the Sea-water, for which they had taken Å¿uch pains, and run Å¿o many adventures in the getting of it: and in this their miÅ¿ery, they Å¿aw but one remedy, and that was a deÅ¿perate one, <hi>viz.</hi> to run into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrote Sea to their Shallops to Å¿ave the remainder of their ProviÅ¿ions, now ready
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38362:39"/>
to be waÅ¿hed away by the billows: This they did, and by main force drew the Shallops to the Å¿hore; then they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the Sea-Å¿ide to gather up Å¿uch of their ProviÅ¿ions as was Å¿wimming up and down: and when the weather prov'd fair, they went on to <hi>Bell-Å¿ound:</hi> where being arrived, they took out their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, and viewed the great Tent which was built of Timber and Boards, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>FlemiÅ¿h</hi> Tiles: The uÅ¿e of it was for the Coopers to work and lodge in whilÅ¿t they made Cask for the putting up of the Traine-Oyle; and they reÅ¿olved to build another Å¿maller Tent within that for their Habitations; and accordingly, taking down a leÅ¿Å¿er Tent that Å¿tood near to it, wherein the Landmen lay whilÅ¿t they made their Oyle, they fetched their materials from thence, both Boards, PoÅ¿ts, and Rafters, and from the Chimnies of the Furnaces, they took a thouÅ¿and Bricks; they found alÅ¿o four HogÅ¿heads of Lime, which mingled with Å¿and from the Å¿hoar, made good morter: But the weather was grown Å¿o extream cold, that they were fain to make two fires on both Å¿ides, to keep their morter from freezing; then they raiÅ¿ed a wall of one Brick thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s againÅ¿t the inner planks of the Å¿ide of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38362:39"/>
the Tent; but by that time they had wall'd two Å¿ides of their houÅ¿e, their Bricks fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Å¿o that they were forc'd to build the other two Å¿ides of boards; which being nail'd on both Å¿ides the poÅ¿ts, they were hollow between, which they fill'd up with Å¿and, that made it Å¿o tite, that the leaÅ¿t breath of air could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly annoy them. The length of their Tent was twenty foot, and the breadth Å¿ixteen; their Chimney was the breadth of a deal board, and four foot high; they ciel'd it with boards five or Å¿ix times double, that no wind could poÅ¿Å¿ibly get through: The door they made as cloÅ¿e as they could, and lin'd it with a bed that they found there, which came over both the opening and Å¿hutting of it: they made no Windows, having no light but what came through the Chimney: then Å¿et they up four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, quartering themÅ¿elves two and two in a Cabin; their Beds were the Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins dry'd, which was a warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable lodging for them in their diÅ¿treÅ¿s: their next care was for firing, and finding Å¿even old Shallops which were unÅ¿ervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they brake them up, and Å¿tow'd them over the beams in the great Tent to make it the warmer, and to keep the Snow from driving through the Tiles into
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38362:40"/>
the Tent: and by this time the cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿ing, and Å¿carce having any day at all, they Å¿tav'd Å¿ome empty Cask, and brake two old coolers (wherein they coole their Oile) providing whatÅ¿oever firing they could without prejudice to the next years Voyage: yet conÅ¿idering the Å¿mall quantity of fuel, the extremity of cold, and the long time of their aboad, they husbanded it as thriftily as poÅ¿Å¿ibly they could.</p>
               <p>Having thus fitted every thing in the beÅ¿t manner they could, on the twelfth of <hi>September,</hi> looking out into the Sound, they eÅ¿pied two Sea-horÅ¿es lying aÅ¿leep on a piece of Ice, whereupon, taking up an old harping-iron, they haÅ¿tn'd to them, and firÅ¿t Å¿lew the old one, and then the young; and Å¿o bringing them aÅ¿hore, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Not long after they kill'd another; but the nights and cold weather encreaÅ¿ing on them, and they viewing their ProviÅ¿ion, found it too Å¿mall by half; whereupon they Å¿tinted themÅ¿elves to one reaÅ¿onable meal a day, and agreed to faÅ¿t <hi>WedneÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> excepting from the Graves or Fritters of the Whale (which was a very loathÅ¿ome meat) of which they allow'd themÅ¿elves Å¿ufficient for

their preÅ¿ent hunger: at which diet they continu'd about three months.</p>
               <p>Having finiÅ¿hed whatever they could invent for their preÅ¿ervation; they found that all their Cloaths and Shooes were worn, and torn; to repair which, they had this new deviÅ¿e; of Rope-yarn they made thread, and of Whale-bones nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to Å¿ew their Cloaths withal: But <hi>October</hi> the tenth, the nights being grown very long, and the cold Å¿o violent, that all the Sea was frozen over; and they having now nothing to exerciÅ¿e their minds upon, were troubled with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and imaginations: Sometimes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd their abÅ¿ence from their Wives and Children, thinking what grief it would be to them to hear of their miÅ¿car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: then thought they of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and what a cutting corraÅ¿ive it would be to them to hear of their untimely deaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being thus tormented in their minds with fear, and grief, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their bodies with hunger, and cold, the hideous monÅ¿ter of deÅ¿peration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented his uglieÅ¿t Å¿hape unto them: But thinking it not beÅ¿t to give way to grief and fear, they doubled their prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for Å¿trength and patience in their miÅ¿eries, by whoÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, they

Å¿hook off their former thoughts, and cheared up themÅ¿elves to uÅ¿e the beÅ¿t means for their preÅ¿ervation.</p>
               <p>Then for the preÅ¿ervation of their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿on, and lengthening of their firing, they thought beÅ¿t to roaÅ¿t every day half a Deer, and to Å¿tow it in HogÅ¿heads, which accordingly they did, leaving Å¿o much raw as would Å¿erve to roaÅ¿t every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day a quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when this was over, they began again to think of their enÅ¿uing miÅ¿ery, that in caÅ¿e God Å¿hould give them life, yet they were to live as BaniÅ¿hed men from all Company; and as if their Å¿orrows had been too little, they preÅ¿ently found an encreaÅ¿e of it; for their Whale-Fritters, after they had been drenched in the Sea-water, lying cloÅ¿e together, were grown mouldy, and Å¿poyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and again Å¿urveying their Bear, and VeniÅ¿on, they found that it would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them five meals a week, whereupon they were fain to cut off one meal more; Å¿o that for three months after, four day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the beginning of this darkneÅ¿s, they Å¿ought Å¿ome means to preÅ¿erve light, and finding a piece of Å¿heet-lead, and Å¿ome Oyl in the Coopers Tent, and Rope-yarn, they made a Lamp, which they kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning, which was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them in their extremity; yet their wants and miÅ¿eries were Å¿o many, and great, that Å¿ometimes they brake forth into impatient Å¿peeches againÅ¿t the cauÅ¿ers of them, but then their ConÅ¿ciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain minded them of their own evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erts, and Å¿o they took it as a juÅ¿t hand of God for their former wicked lives, or that God intended to make them exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Mercy in their wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: Humbling themÅ¿elves therefore under the mighty hand of God, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trated themÅ¿elves in prayer two or three times a day, which courÅ¿e they conÅ¿tantly held all the time of their miÅ¿ery.</p>

In the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> as the days began to lengthen, the cold began to Å¿trengthen; which proceeded to that extremity, that it raiÅ¿ed bliÅ¿ters on their fleÅ¿h as if they had been burnt with fire, and if at any time they touched Iron, it would Å¿tick to their fingers like bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime: If they went out a doors to fetch in a little water, it would Å¿o pinch them, that they were Å¿ore as if they had been beaten.

               <p>By the laÅ¿t of <hi>January</hi> the days were Å¿even or eight hours long, and then view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their victuals again, they found that it would not laÅ¿t above Å¿ix weeks longer, which made them fear further Famine; but they had recourÅ¿e to God, who they knew, could Å¿upply them beyond their hopes.</p>
               <p>Looking out on a bright day, they Å¿aw a great Å¿he Bear with her Cub coming towards their Tent, whereupon arming themÅ¿elves with their Lances, they went

The Å¿ame day there came two Å¿hips of <hi>Hull</hi> into the Sound, who knowing that Å¿ome men had been left there the year before, being very deÅ¿irous to know whether they were dead or alive, the MaÅ¿ter mann'd forth a Å¿hallop to go as near the Å¿hore as they

The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wain Å¿eeing this <hi>John Watts</hi> was thus carried away, was reÅ¿olv'd with his other two Companions to have him again, or elÅ¿e to venture all their lives for him: They arm themÅ¿elves; but whilÅ¿t they were conÅ¿ulting what to do, whether to venture on Å¿hore, or not, of a Å¿udden they were beÅ¿et with about a dozen men in Å¿everal Canoes, but they valiantly maintained their Boat about the Å¿pace of three hours, for after two of their three MuÅ¿quets were diÅ¿charged, they defended themÅ¿elves with their Oars, and Boat-hooks. The BoatÅ¿wain receiv'd a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two adventur'd in the River, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by Å¿wimming to eÅ¿cape the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileÅ¿s hands of cruel Infidels; but the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> with their Å¿wift Canoes Å¿oon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them, and brought them on Å¿hore to the place where the relator was. The <hi>Negroes</hi> took out the BoatÅ¿wain out of

the Å¿hips boat; and inÅ¿tead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all to preÅ¿erve life which remained in him, immediately they rob'd him of it; one of them with a keen weapon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his head before his Companions faces; and then they prepare for their rare banquet, while he was yet reeking in his blood: they in a barbarous manner cutting off pieces of fleÅ¿h from off his But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, and his Thighs, and his Arms, and Shoulders, and broiled them on the coals, and with a great deal of impatience, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly eat it before our faces, to our great aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment. About fourteen days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one of the Company fell Å¿ick, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of being PhyÅ¿icians to cure him, they were his Butchers to murther him. They Å¿erved him as they did the BoatÅ¿wain, cut off his head, and broil'd and eat up his fleÅ¿h, and rejoyced exceedingly at this rich Banquet. About ten days after, the third fell Å¿ick, whom they Å¿erved in the Å¿ame manner.</p>
               <p>This was no Å¿mall cauÅ¿e of Å¿orrow to the Relator; the thoughts of their Inhumane and Barbarous actions Å¿ometimes Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him with fears and Å¿orrows, hourly expecting to taÅ¿t of the Å¿aid Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.

left now alone, in a Å¿trange Country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titute of friends or acquaintance, or any thing that might keep up his Spirits: dye he would fain, but not by the hands of Infidels and barbarous MonÅ¿ters. But the great God that is moÅ¿t compaÅ¿Å¿ionate in the greateÅ¿t extremities had pity on him, and notwithÅ¿tanding the alteration of the Climate, and the want of Cloaths, and the Å¿trangeneÅ¿s of his food, which was only herbs, he continued in good health, and had time enough to lament this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence. The Natives who were daily expecting another banquet, met with a diÅ¿appointment: either their cuÅ¿toms, or the over-ruling power of God, would not Å¿uffer them to deÅ¿troy him, he continuing Å¿till in health.

In the Boat, which in the beginning they took with them, was a MuÅ¿quet Å¿aved of the three which was not diÅ¿charged; which his MaÅ¿ter, Å¿ome time after he had been with him, brought to him to know the uÅ¿e of it: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd as much as he could to make him apprehend the uÅ¿e of it, but Å¿till they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t their ignorance: but they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and threatned him to Å¿hew the uÅ¿e of it. The fear of his maÅ¿ters diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure and their inhumanity, cauÅ¿ed him to Å¿hoot it off; but the <hi>Negroes,</hi> which expected Å¿ome delightful thing, were fruÅ¿trated, and at the Å¿uddain noiÅ¿e and flaÅ¿h of fire (which they very much dread) ran from him, and were greatly affrighted; but quickly after, hearing no more of that noiÅ¿e, they came up to him again, and commanded him to do the like: he told them he had not powder, which was the cauÅ¿e of the noiÅ¿e; but this would not Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie theÅ¿e Barbarians. He not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anÅ¿wer their expectation, they concluded he was not willing, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to threaten him, and were about to murder him, had not his maÅ¿ter reÅ¿cued him. Upon diÅ¿courÅ¿e after with this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannia,</hi> or MaÅ¿ter, he began to underÅ¿tand the reaÅ¿on of their barbarous dealing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38362:47"/>
with him and his Friends, he telling him that naturally the People were civil and Å¿imply honeÅ¿t, but if provoked full of revenge; and that this Cruelty was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion'd by Å¿ome unhandÅ¿ome action of carrying a Native away without their leave, about a year before; they reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, if any came aÅ¿hore, they Å¿hould never go off alive. He had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Å¿even weeks in the Country, but his MaÅ¿ter preÅ¿ented him to his King, whoÅ¿e name was <hi>E-fa-me,</hi> King of the <hi>Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores,</hi> who immediately gave him to his Daughter, whoÅ¿e name was <hi>Oni-jah,</hi> and when the King went abroad, he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him alÅ¿o as his Page, throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above twelve miles, yet boaÅ¿ting extremely of his power and Å¿trength, but glorying exceedingly that he had a White to attend him, whom he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry his Bow and Arrows; at Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places remote from the Sea-Å¿ide, the people would run away from him for fear, others would fall down and Å¿eem to worÅ¿hip him, and uÅ¿e thoÅ¿e actions as they do to their God.

He told him as much as his underÅ¿tanding and years made him capable of, keeping Å¿till in the bounds of modeÅ¿ty, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible to the honour,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38362:48"/>
and dignity of his Soveraign; firÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of the greatneÅ¿s of one of his Kingdoms, the Å¿everal Shires and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it contained, with number of its Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Towns and CaÅ¿tles, and the Å¿trength of each, the infinite Inhabitants, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his Subjects. One of theÅ¿e King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms was enough to amaze Å¿ufficiently this petty Governour, that he need not to mention any more of his MajeÅ¿ties Glory and Dignity. It put him into Å¿uch a profound conÅ¿ternation, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved to find out Å¿ome way to tender his reÅ¿pects to this mighty Prince, and no way could he find Å¿o convenient, as to tell the Relator, that if he could find but a paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿age, he would let him go to <hi>England,</hi> to tell his MajeÅ¿ty of the great favour and reÅ¿pect he had for him. This did not a little rejoyce our EngliÅ¿h-man. Withall the King told him, that he would Å¿end him a PreÅ¿ent, which Å¿hould be two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bareets or Goats, which they do value at a very high rate; the King having not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 16 or 18. He tells the King, that the King of <hi>England</hi> had many thouÅ¿ands of his Subjects that were under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Gentlemen, which had a thouÅ¿and of Sheep a piece; the fleÅ¿h of which, they valu'd at a very much higher rate than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38362:49"/>
Goats. Though our EngliÅ¿h-man lived very handÅ¿omely with this <hi>E-fn-man-cha,</hi> King of the <hi>Ca-la-nanch,</hi> yet his deÅ¿ires and his hopes were Å¿till for his Native Country: at length he obtain'd a promiÅ¿e from his King, that the firÅ¿t EngliÅ¿h Å¿hip that came into that Road, Å¿hould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ReleaÅ¿e or PurchaÅ¿e him; this very much rejoyced his heart: now he thought every day a year, till he could hear of, or Å¿ee Å¿ome EngliÅ¿h Å¿hip arrived. Many times when he was alone, his heart would be oppreÅ¿t with Å¿ighs and Å¿ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, when ke thought of his Relations, and the comfortable Å¿ociety that they had together; that it Å¿hould be his Å¿ad lot to be captivated amongÅ¿t barbarous Infidels. Oftentimes did he walk down to the Sea-Å¿ide, Å¿ometimes with hopes, Å¿ometimes with fear, earneÅ¿tly expecting the wind of Gods providence to blow in Å¿ome EngliÅ¿h Ship thither: his often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e to the Sea-Å¿ide was diÅ¿cerned by one <hi>Ja-ga,</hi> a Wizard, and the chiefeÅ¿t in three or four Kingdoms there-abouts; they are perÅ¿ons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult occaÅ¿ion, run to them for Å¿atisfaction. The famous Delphean Oracle was never had in greater adoration, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical

Though they have infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them in every place, yet this <hi>Ja-ga</hi> had the moÅ¿t renown amongÅ¿t them; and one day he comes to him, and very kindly ask'd him, Why he Å¿o very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten frequented that place? he told him, To Å¿ee if he could diÅ¿cover any <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> VeÅ¿Å¿el to come in there: but he being not acquainted with his Great fame, Askt him When he did believe there would one come in? not that he was willing to give credit to any of their Divinations, but Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing that he thereby Å¿hould pleaÅ¿e him and anÅ¿wer his expectation. <hi>Ja-ga</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately told him, That the Fifteenth day after an <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Ship Å¿hould come into the Road. Then he askt him, Whether that Ship Å¿hould carry him away. To this he anÅ¿wer'd doubtfully, but told him, That he Å¿hould be offer'd to the MaÅ¿ter of the Å¿hip, and if they could not agree, but that he Å¿hould come to Shore again, he Å¿hould not be Sold, and that in a very Å¿hort time after he Å¿hould dye for Grief.

JuÅ¿t

by the Sea-Å¿ide; as he was about to launch his little floating Stick, he eÅ¿pied a Great <hi>Aligator,</hi> which will devour a Man at a Mouthful; this made him alter his ReÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and reÅ¿olve rather to live with Inhumane Infidels, than to throw himÅ¿elf into Å¿o imminent a danger, which would have been little leÅ¿s than Å¿elf-murther. But the next day, which I may call a day of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> Almighty God opened the heart of the King to let the poor EngliÅ¿h Man go: he Å¿ent him in a Canoe, placed between a Negroe's Legs, with Å¿ome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Guide this Å¿mall VeÅ¿Å¿el, for fear he Å¿hould leap over board and Å¿wim to the Ship.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38362:51"/>
to the Ship again, and they deliver'd him on board for Forty five Copper Bars and Iron Bars; each Copper bar being about the bigneÅ¿s of a Youths little finger, the Iron bars a little bigger. Now were his joys compleated, he thought himÅ¿elf, as it were, caught up into the Third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; he could hardly perÅ¿wade himÅ¿elf but it was a Dream or ViÅ¿ion, and that he did not really Å¿ee EngliÅ¿h faces, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace EngliÅ¿h bodies. It was Å¿ome time before he could throw himÅ¿elf at the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains feet, and acknwledge his infinite cauÅ¿e of joy in himÅ¿elf, and thankfulneÅ¿s to him for his deliverance from Å¿uch a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Captivity; that he that lately was a Å¿lave to Infidels, that worÅ¿hip they know not what, Å¿hould now Å¿ee the Faces of ChriÅ¿tians, and joyn with them in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hiping the true God; and to him firÅ¿t he offer'd up the Sacrifice of hearty thankÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, that had Å¿ent his Angel to redeem him from Å¿o cruel a bondage. When he came on board, his hair was very long, and his skin tawny <hi>(Malatto-</hi>like) having gone naked all the time he was there, and frequently anointing himÅ¿elf with Palm-Oyl he looked like a Tawny Moore; but immediately the Seamen aboard with ChriÅ¿tian-like hearts, apparelled him.

The 8th we had the Wind at <hi>North WeÅ¿t</hi> by <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> we plied to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and it blew very hard; the 10th we took two Reefs in our TopÅ¿ails; the 12th we took in our TopÅ¿ails, and Ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed CoÅ¿ts; the 13th about One in the Morning we Sprung a Leak, in Å¿o much that we were forced to Å¿et both our Pumps to Work, and bear away before the Wind; yet Å¿till the Water increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed; and the 14th we cut our Main-Sail from the Yard, and let him fly over-board, the Weather being Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ive thick by reaÅ¿on of the extraordinary much Snow that then fell, that we could not Å¿ee the Land, nor any place where we could run our Ship AÅ¿hore to Å¿ave our Lives; The 15th in the Morning, about One of the Clock, by Fortune, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected of us, before we Å¿ee any Land, we Å¿truck upon an IÅ¿land, called by the

Soon after the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ians</hi> came there, that Man that Å¿aved his Life, and got well home with the Merchant, when the other Three were Starved with the Cold Died, that was Four that was Dead, our Complyment at firÅ¿t was 27, but then we had but 23 Living: Then our Merchant went to the <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿ians,</hi> and deÅ¿ired them to put us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when we came over we lay where there was 1000 Men a FiÅ¿hing, The firÅ¿t Night: and the next Morning we hired Sledges to drag us to Å¿ome place Inhabited: The BeaÅ¿ts that dragg'd the Sledges along they call <hi>Roeys,</hi> they are like Dear, but larger: We were forc'd to be Dragg'd, we could not Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel our Limbs were Å¿o diÅ¿abled with the Cold before we got off the aforeÅ¿aid I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿land: beÅ¿ides the Snow was of Å¿uch a vaÅ¿t thickneÅ¿s, and Å¿o hard Frozen, that we could find no Path, if we could Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel never Å¿o well, If the <hi>Shamakes,</hi> as they call them, had not Å¿hown us the way; the firÅ¿t Night of our Journey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sledges our Carpenters Mate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Å¿o we made a Hole in the Snow and put him in, and left him.

We have the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion of his Voyage, <hi>(viz.) Paul</hi> being then a Sufferer and a PriÅ¿oner, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to <hi>CaeÅ¿ar,</hi> and Å¿o is Å¿ent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there bears a faithful TeÅ¿timony for JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 1.) 2. We have the Dangers that occurred in the Voyage, and theÅ¿e are alÅ¿o carefully Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 9.) Now much time was Å¿pent, and Sailing was now dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the FaÅ¿t was already paÅ¿t: This was the yearly Fast of the <hi>Jews,</hi> on which the attonement for all the people was made by the High-PrieÅ¿t, in the holy of holies; which day was the 10. of the 7th Month, <hi>(Lev.</hi> 16. 29.) which partly agreed with our <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> in which time the Sea, was not Sailed in, by the Ancients, until the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> becauÅ¿e of the Å¿hortneÅ¿s of the days, and the violence of the TempeÅ¿ts, they were prone to in thoÅ¿e Parts, this is the Å¿enÅ¿e of Interpreters upon the place. 1. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Voyage we read of, is this, the winds were contrary, <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 4.) this is Å¿poken of the Voyage of the DiÅ¿ciples, The winds were contrary. 2. Danger, there aroÅ¿e not only a contrary wind,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:38362:64"/>
but a violent wind, called an <hi>Euroclydon, (verÅ¿.</hi> 14.) Å¿ome read it a Whirle-wind, but it is ment of an <hi>EaÅ¿t-</hi>wind, which raiÅ¿es the Sea mightily. 3. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peÅ¿t was Å¿o great and violent upon them, that they were glad to let the Ship drive, <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 15.)</p>
            <p>3. We have not only the Danger in this Voyage, but their marvelous Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and PreÅ¿ervation; for they came off all of them with their lives, <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 44.) the particulars whereof you may Å¿ee.</p>
            <p>In the Text we have three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervable. 1. Their endeavors in this great diÅ¿treÅ¿s to preÅ¿erve themÅ¿elves. 1. They lightned the Ship, and what was it Å¿he was laden with? it was Wheat, <hi>(verÅ¿.</hi> 38.) They lightned the Ship, and caÅ¿t the Wheat into the Sea; thus did <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Mariners caÅ¿t out the Wares. Alas, what are theÅ¿e things, but lumber to lives? if it were Gold, it muÅ¿t go for Life. <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi> Then what Å¿hould a man give for his Soul? what will a man give for his Soul? what will a man give in exchange for his Soul? 2. Endeavor; they caÅ¿t out the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Ship; any thing they part with to Å¿ave their lives, though never Å¿o uÅ¿eful to them; even that which was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38362:64"/>
neceÅ¿Å¿ary for their Voyage, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceÅ¿Å¿ity to part with it, for the preÅ¿ervation of their lives.</p>
            <p>2. We have their Dangers as well as Endeavors. 1. It is expreÅ¿t in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the TempeÅ¿t; they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly toÅ¿Å¿ed with a TempeÅ¿t. 2. It was dark weather, neither Sun nor Stars appeared, which uÅ¿ed to be great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and helps to poor men at Sea. 3. Their Danger is expreÅ¿t in this, they were brought to the brink of the black pit of DeÅ¿pair; all Hope now was taken away. O what a Å¿ad diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed condition was this! their Hope, which is called the Anchor of the Soul, yea which is the Sheet-Anchor of the Soul, was loÅ¿t; they gave all their lives over for gone and loÅ¿t: And oh, what could now a company of men do that had loÅ¿t their Hopes and Hearts? could theÅ¿e that had loÅ¿t their Hopes find their hands? they were now Å¿aying, as the Jews did in their Captivity, Our Hope is loÅ¿t, we are cut off for our parts, <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 37. 11.)</p>
            <p>3. We have their Deliverance and PreÅ¿ervation, coming in at Å¿uch a time and Å¿eaÅ¿on as this was; now that they are brought to an extremity, God makes it his opportunity; and now that all hope
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38362:65"/>
of being Å¿aved is taken away, Å¿alvation will be moÅ¿t Å¿eaÅ¿onable: and now the Angel appears to <hi>Paul,</hi> and tells him, all their lives are enÅ¿ured, only the Å¿hip Å¿hall be loÅ¿t.</p>

               <head>ObÅ¿ervations are theÅ¿e:</head>
               <item>1. <hi>Dangers and Deliverances are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recorded and remembred; therefore</hi> Paul <hi>takes an account of both, here in this Voyage.</hi>

As <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Corinthians what danger they were in; they were preÅ¿t out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, out of Å¿trength, in Å¿o much that they deÅ¿paired of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Å¿o at Sea as well as Land, he would have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers remembred; how that they go up to the Heaven one while, and Å¿ink into the deeps another; their Soul melted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e of trouble, and they at their wits ends, <hi>&amp;c. Peter</hi>'s danger at Sea is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he began to Å¿ink, and cried out, MaÅ¿ter, Å¿ave me, or I periÅ¿h, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30.)

1. Dangers Å¿hould be remembred, conÅ¿idering we may come into them again. Many when dangers are not, they Å¿ing to their Souls that Å¿ong, and delude themÅ¿elves, The bitterneÅ¿s of Death is paÅ¿t; they think they are out of one Å¿trom, and they Å¿hall never come in Å¿uch another. JuÅ¿t as perÅ¿ons do with their SickneÅ¿s at Land, Å¿o many do with their Dangers at Sea, if God bring them off: O they grow hardned and Å¿ecure again. But if God hath brought home one dangerous Voyage, we Å¿hould think, it may be the next will be as dangerous; Have I eÅ¿caped one at Sea, one at Land? if I do not improve it, if I do not walk Å¿uitable under it, O how eaÅ¿ily can God bring me into another. You never were in Å¿uch Dangers, but you may come to the like again, whether at Sea or Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dangers Å¿hould be remembred with conÅ¿ideration to the greatneÅ¿s of them; great things Å¿hould be remembred, a great God, great Mercies, great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, great Sins, and great Dangers. How Å¿hould we think, O what a Danger was I in at this time by Å¿uch a Storm at Sea! by Å¿uch a SickneÅ¿s aÅ¿hore! not only my Life in danger, but Lord, was not my Soul in danger? was I fit to die at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38362:66"/>
Å¿uch a time? had I gotten an intereÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t, if I had been caÅ¿t away at Å¿uch a time? Men think dangers great for their Bodies, but they do not think them Å¿o for their Souls; they think them great for their Ships, for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tates, but they do not think them Å¿o for their Eternal conditions; O, had not my Body, Soul, Ship, and all periÅ¿hed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And was not this a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? thy Souls danger was the greateÅ¿t danger; hadÅ¿t thou been drowned at Å¿uch a time, thy Soul had been Å¿hipwrackt to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Dangers Å¿hould be remembred with conÅ¿ideration to their Å¿uddenneÅ¿s; how many times do they come Å¿uddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? As there is Å¿udden fear, Å¿o there is Å¿udden danger. When the Lord Å¿ends the Winds out of his TreaÅ¿ury Å¿uddenly, and threatens men at Sea with Å¿udden deÅ¿truction, when deÅ¿olation Å¿eems to come as a Whirl-wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we Å¿hould think, What if Å¿udden death had come upon me, what a condition was my poor Soul in? what a dreadful thing would it have been if I had been Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿ed on a Å¿udden, and Å¿ent into an Eternal condition, in the twinkling of an eye?

            <p n="2">2. We are to remember our frames of Å¿pirit when God brings us out of our dangers; how then we were melted with the preÅ¿ent Å¿enÅ¿e of the mercy; as thoÅ¿e IÅ¿raelites, when God brought them out of danger, they believed God, they Å¿ang and gave praiÅ¿e; O what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutions were there then upon the Soul to be given up anew to God; to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the light of the living.

And then what a frame of heart was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? <hi>Return unto thy reÅ¿t, O my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(PÅ¿al.</hi> 116. 6, 7.)

we may not wear totally the Å¿enÅ¿e of them off our Å¿pirits.</p>
            <p>5. We Å¿hould remember our dangers, with conÅ¿ideration to the frequency of them; how frequently we were in them. <hi>Paul</hi> remembred this, in Perils by Sea often, in Perils by the Heathen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) O how often have we been near Drowning, near Taking, near Sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, near Dying, and yet God brought us off; theÅ¿e things we Å¿hould call to mind often; go out upon dangerous Voyages, and often come home; the oftner and more frequent our dangers, the more Å¿hould we think upon them.</p>
            <p>2. We Å¿hould Remember our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, but how? 1. We Å¿hould Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, Å¿o as to admire them; thus did the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Ezra, Who hath given them Å¿uch deliverance as this?</hi> O! they admire it, and write a Non-Å¿uch upon the Head of it, as <hi>David</hi> admired the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of God, when he had Å¿poken of his HouÅ¿e to come. Is this the manner of men, O God? He was in an holy ExtaÅ¿y of Heavenly admiration; Å¿o Å¿hould you Å¿ay now; to carry out, and bring home, in Å¿uch a dangerous time as this; To hide from Enemies, when Å¿ought for in Å¿uch a time Å¿uch a Voyage as this: Oh! <hi>

What a Voyage is this? God loves to have his Mercies admired by us.</p>
            <p>2. We Å¿hould Remember our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, to have our Hearts raiÅ¿ed up in gratitude, and thankfulneÅ¿s to God for them; Thus did <hi>David, I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, in preÅ¿ence of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> PÅ¿al. 116. 12, 13, 14.

What, not be thankful for Å¿uch a PreÅ¿ervation as this?</p>
            <p>3. We Å¿hould Remember our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, Å¿o as to endear our Hearts to God; Thus we find <hi>David, I will love thee, O Lord, I will love the Lord dearly,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How are we engaged to a Friend that is at any time but an InÅ¿trument in God's hand to Deliver us? And Å¿hall we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to the InÅ¿trument, and not to the Author? O!

            <p>4. We Å¿hould Remember our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to improve them in a way of acting Faith, when the next danger and Å¿traits comes: <hi>I will remember thee from the Land of Jordan, from the Hill</hi> MiÅ¿Å¿ar, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 42. 6, 7. This was to encourage him from his former Deliverances in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Å¿traits and exigencies. What, now diÅ¿truÅ¿t God, who hath delivered in Å¿ix Troubles, and now Å¿hall we give way to Unbelief in the Seventh? Did not holy <hi>David</hi> thus? <hi>He hath delivered me out of the Paw of the Lyon, and out of the Paw of the Bear, and he will deliver me out of the hand of the uncircumciÅ¿ed PhiliÅ¿tine.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> remembers his Deliverance from <hi>Nero. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord Å¿hall delive me from every evil work,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 17, 18.</p>

            <p n="1">1. We Å¿hould Commemorate our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with our Deliverances, becauÅ¿e God gives them to that end. The Lord doth not give us our Deliverances to caÅ¿t them at our heels, nor brings us out of our Dangers, that we might forget them, as tho we had never been in any of them. God expects that we Å¿hould faithfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿ter and Record them; therefore it was a great Provocation to the Lord, that the Children of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> Å¿o Å¿oon forgot his works: If you do but forget the kindneÅ¿s of a Friend, you think it is diÅ¿ingenious; but O then, What is it to forget that God that hath delivered you out of Å¿ix trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and in Å¿even troubles?

2. We Å¿hould Commemorate our Dangers and Deliverances, becauÅ¿e it was freely of his grace to bring us out of the one, and put us under the other; Is it not of his meer mercy that he reÅ¿cu'd and pull'd us out of our dangers? Might not we elÅ¿e been Å¿wallow'd up of them?

One Man goes to Sea, and he is taken; another goes to Sea, and he is Å¿unk; another goes to Sea, and he dies the Term of the Voyage; And why doth the Lord preÅ¿erve you?

3. Our Dangers and Deliverances Å¿hould be remembred, becauÅ¿e God hath gracious ends and deÅ¿igns both in the one and the other; What ends hath God to bring us into dangers? 1. He by this hath an end and deÅ¿ign to quicken up to duty; it may be there may be Å¿ome omitted duty; neglected duties often bring Men into great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers; it may be a PerÅ¿on is convinced of the duty of Prayer, but it may be neglected; Oh then God will bring into danger to quicken to duty; Oh, Å¿ays God, <hi>In their affliction they will Å¿eek me early.</hi> The very Heathen Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners called out for Prayer in time of danger. ObÅ¿erve it, that PerÅ¿ons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of duties, either PerÅ¿onal or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meÅ¿tical, and yet neglected, God uÅ¿ually whips them to their Duties, by one dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, affliction or another. The Proverb is good, if you would teach a Man to Pray, Å¿end him to Sea. 2. God by bringing us into dangers, hath a deÅ¿ign upon us to convince us of Å¿in; many Convictions hath come into the Soul at this door; Dangers have often proved inlets to Convictions. Oh! What Convictions have many poor Souls lain under while in danger, when it may be the dangers hath
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38362:71"/>
given them a view of Eternity; when Dangers hath preÅ¿ented Death to the Man, and ConÅ¿cience hath cried, Now thou art Å¿inking, now there is but a Å¿tep betwixt thee and Eternity, betwixt thee and another World? Oh then what Convictions hath the Soul lyen under? and yet it may be when the Danger is over, the Conviction is over too. Well, though we may forget all, yet God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members all. 3. God hath a deÅ¿ign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in our Dangers, to prepare us for our latter end. The danger thou art in, and hath eÅ¿caped, calls for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for thy Death, which muÅ¿t certainly come to paÅ¿s Å¿hortly. God by Dangers would have you prepare for Death: And Oh! VVhat a cutting ConÅ¿ideration will this be when thou com'Å¿t to die? that thou who haÅ¿t been in Å¿o many dangers by Sea and Land, Å¿hould have no more learned to die, nor ready to die. Alas, you eÅ¿caped the laÅ¿t, that you might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the next. 4. God hath a deÅ¿ign upon our Graces by bringing us into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Danger is to exert and draw forth Grace. Thus the DiÅ¿ciples Dangers at Sea were to draw forth their Faith. Faith and Patience comes moÅ¿t viÅ¿ibly upon the Å¿tage in times of moÅ¿t eminent danger.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:38362:71"/>
5. God by bringing us into Dangers, hath a deÅ¿ign upon our Souls; he Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by danger of drowning the Body, hath Å¿aved the Soul, and hath cauÅ¿ed it to Å¿ay, <hi>PeriiÅ¿Å¿em niÅ¿i periiÅ¿sem:</hi> I had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hed, if I had not periÅ¿hed. Some have eÅ¿caped Shipwrack of Soul, by Shipwrack of Body; And Å¿hall we forget Å¿uch Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when God hath Å¿uch gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns in them upon us?</p>
            <p>2. He drives on gracious ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns in our Deliverances, And Å¿hall we then forget them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. He Å¿pares us, that we may account his long-Å¿uffering Salvation; he gives, by Å¿paring of us, Å¿pace to Repent; and Oh! What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He delivers, that we may live to him. Why was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s feet deliver'd from falling? it was, that he might walk before the Lord in the light of the living. He gives us our lives, that we might give them back again to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 10. Men are not deliver'd from dangers to live to themÅ¿elves, to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38362:72"/>
live to their luÅ¿ts, to Drink, and Swear, and Rant, and Roar, as a great many poor Wretches do. That Å¿ay as they did, <hi>We are deliver'd to do all theÅ¿e abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> PÅ¿al. 50. 15. 3. God hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in Deliverance, that we might glorifie him, in paying our Vows to him. <hi>I will deliver thee;</hi> And what then when out of Trouble never remember it more, caÅ¿t it behind thy back; O no; <hi>And thou Å¿halt glorifie me.</hi> He aims at a revenue of glory out of your deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 4. God hath another end in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of us; that we might enter into New Engagements, to be more the Lords; as in times of great dangers, there uÅ¿e to be great engagements betwixt God and the Soul; Å¿o in times of Great Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are great Engagements paÅ¿s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Soul, New Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God; New Deliverances call for New Dedications of the Soul to God; now the Soul Å¿hould be Å¿et apart for God more than ever. 5. God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother end in delivering of us, that we might break off our league with Å¿in; thus it was with them, <hi>Shall we break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, after Å¿uch great deliverance as this?</hi>

Our Dangers have been Å¿uch, as we have often deÅ¿paired of Life; there hath but been a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and Death; nay, betwixt us and Eternity; And Å¿hall we forget Å¿uch dangers, when we have been Å¿o near death in them? As he Å¿aid to <hi>David, As the Lord lives, there is but one Å¿tep betwixt thee and death.</hi> O how often have you been near Å¿inking, near drowning, and yet God hath then appeared for you, with an outÅ¿tretched Arm, and in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38362:75"/>
Mount hath been Å¿een, And will you not remember this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this ReÅ¿pect, they are Å¿udden and Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, they are wonderfully Å¿udden; How are you often, all on a Å¿udden, threatned with nothing but preÅ¿ent Death and DeÅ¿truction? It may be Å¿aid of Sea-men, as of thoÅ¿e in <hi>Job, Snares compaÅ¿Å¿es them about, and Å¿udden fear trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth them,</hi> Job 22. 10. It doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble them, but all on a Å¿udden trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, before they know almoÅ¿t where they are (as we Å¿ay;) VVe read of Å¿ome whoÅ¿e Calamity Å¿hall come Å¿uddenly. <hi>Suddenly Å¿hall he be broken without Remedy,</hi> Prov. 6. 15. O how terrible is Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, or Å¿uch a danger And hath not God often threatned to make this your caÅ¿e and condition? O then do not forget Å¿uch dangers that have Å¿o Å¿uddenly lookt you in the Face!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Dangers are VVonderful in this ReÅ¿pect, they are not Dangers in which your Bodies are concerned only, but they are Dangers in which your Souls are concerned; It is not only the danger of a Ship-wrack'd VeÅ¿Å¿el, and a Ship-wrack'd EÅ¿tate, and a Shipwrack'd Body, but a Shipwrack'd Soul. Here
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38362:75"/>
is the great danger, leÅ¿t thou make a loÅ¿t Voyage for thy Soul: If thou had died in Å¿uch a Storm, or died in the Term of Å¿uch a Voyage; Oh! VVhat would have become of thy Soul, thy precious, thy immortal Soul? Had not thou died in a Carnal, in a ChriÅ¿tleÅ¿s Å¿tate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Had not thy poor Soul periÅ¿h'd to all Eternity, if thou then had miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried? VVas not thou then a Å¿tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger altogether to ChriÅ¿t, and a VVork of Saving Grace upon thy Heart? Had not thou then the guilt of all thy Å¿ins upon the back of thy Soul unpardoned? And O what danger was this! And wilt thou forget Å¿uch dangers?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Dangers are Å¿uch at Sea, as none but a God can deliver from; all your skill cannot; O, then is the greateÅ¿t ArtiÅ¿t at his Wits end! The PÅ¿almiÅ¿t tells us, <hi>(PÅ¿al.</hi> 107. 27.) the Marriners in their Storms, are at their wits end; (or as Å¿ome read it) all their wiÅ¿dom is Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, they know not what courÅ¿e to Steer, (the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annorators carry it,) Now their very Pilots are at a loÅ¿s; Now all their courage cannot contribute to their deliverance, though men of the greateÅ¿t natural courage and magnanimity in the world: Yet now their hearts melt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38362:76"/>
becauÅ¿e of troubles; as it is Å¿aid of the Marriners in <hi>Jonahs</hi> Ship, <hi>The Marriners were afraid.</hi> O now, when Death and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, the Grave and Judgment to come looks them in the face! Then they are <hi>Magor-MiÅ¿Å¿abibs,</hi> terror to themÅ¿elves, and to all about them; O now, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is Å¿uch, it muÅ¿t be the only finger of God that can help! I have heard of a Ship in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, that in a great Storm, they feared the Anchor would come home, and the MaÅ¿ter diÅ¿courÅ¿ing with a Youth in the Ship, that God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun lately to work Å¿ome Convictions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, O Å¿ays he, MaÅ¿ter if God do but lay a Finger upon one Strand of the Cable, it will hold; and in the morning many Ships were loÅ¿t near them, and there was but one Strand in the Cable left. O the finger of God only can Å¿ometimes Å¿ave in dangers. It was a good Å¿aying of a Godly Commander of a Ship in eminent dangers, <hi>None now but that God that Å¿aved the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> IÅ¿rael <hi>at the Red Sea, can Å¿ave us out of this diÅ¿treÅ¿s;</hi> and as Å¿oon as he had Å¿aid it, the Wind altered, and Å¿aved them; And will you forget Å¿uch dangers as none but a God can Å¿ave from?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your dangers at Sea are Å¿uch as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouÅ¿ands have periÅ¿hed in; how many
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38362:76"/>
have gone to Sea, that never returned more? that have been Å¿wallowed up in the belly of the great Deeps? How many have periÅ¿hed by the Sword at Sea? how many by violent Storms? and that God Å¿hould put a difference betwixt you and others, and you Å¿hould forget it, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt. How many have loÅ¿t their lives? how many have loÅ¿t their limbs? and yet in Å¿uch dangers God hath brought you off; this is never to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>2. Your dangers are not only wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but your deliverances are Å¿o too, and therefore Å¿hould be remembred. There is never a deliverance, but you may read a wonder in it; Å¿o many deliverances and Å¿alvations at Sea, Å¿o many wonders. God Å¿aves you in a miraculous way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not this a wonder, that perÅ¿ons of Å¿uch great Å¿ins and provocations, Å¿hould be perÅ¿ons of Å¿uch great Å¿alvations and preÅ¿ervations? that Å¿uch as Å¿in every Voyage, nay, it may be at an high rate Å¿in every Voyage, Å¿hould be Å¿aved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at Å¿uch an high rate every Voyage? is not this a wonder, that men of Å¿uch Å¿ins, Å¿hould be men of Å¿uch Å¿alvations? that men that Å¿in againÅ¿t theÅ¿e Å¿alvations, Å¿hould not have theÅ¿e deliverances Å¿horten
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38362:77"/>
upon them. Oh what a wonder is this! We Å¿hould wonder if a perÅ¿on Å¿hould be continually diÅ¿obliging any of us, and yet we Å¿hould be Å¿till heaping up kindneÅ¿Å¿es upon him: This made the Prophet <hi>Ezra</hi> Å¿ay, <hi>Shall we again break his Commandments, after Å¿uch deliverance as this?</hi> O do not you provoke the Lord every time that you go out, and Å¿till he delivers you, Å¿till he returns you to your Relations, to viÅ¿it your habitations in peace! and is not this a wonder?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your deliverances are wonderful, if you conÅ¿ider your deliverances are great deliverances. We read of Å¿uch; <hi>And the Lord Å¿aved them with a great deliverance;</hi> or with a great Å¿alvation. Thus Å¿aid <hi>SampÅ¿on, Thou haÅ¿t given this great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into the hand of thy Å¿ervant,</hi> (Judg. 15. 18.) Now any great tranÅ¿actions are remembred and recorded. Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances are great, if we conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e things; 1. They are commanded deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances by the great God; his word of command brings all our deliverances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, whether at Sea or Land. Which made the Church in diÅ¿treÅ¿s pray, <hi>Thou art my King, O God, command deliverances for</hi> Jacob, <hi>(PÅ¿al.</hi> 44. 4.) He commands every thing tending to deliverance at Sea; in order to deliverance, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38362:77"/>
the Winds; <hi>He maketh the Å¿torm a calm,</hi> (PÅ¿al. 107. 29.) He alÅ¿o com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Seas; he Å¿ays to the proud Waves, <hi>So far, and no farther.</hi> You read of a decree Å¿et to the Sea, that it cannot paÅ¿s; <hi>Though the Waves thereof toÅ¿s them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not paÅ¿s over it,</hi> (Jer. 5. 22.) It is the great God only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea, to command the Seas and the Waves thereof. God is Å¿aid to Å¿hut up the Sea with doors, and Å¿et bars upon it. <hi>Hitherto Å¿halt thou come, and no further; and here Å¿hall thy proud waves be Å¿tayed,</hi> (Job. 38. 8, 11.) <hi>Xerxes</hi> preÅ¿umed he could tame the <hi>HelleÅ¿pont,</hi> for attempting his Bridge of Boats; but all this was in vain, this is a flower in Gods Crown alone, to command the Sea. Your deliverances are a fruit and effect of Gods commanding Power, therefore great. 2. They are great deliverances, as they are the curious workmanÅ¿hip (as I may call them) of the Attributes of a great God. Deliverance is Å¿aid to be wrought for us, it is the handy work of God; <hi>If God will work, who can let?</hi> (as the Prophet Å¿aith, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 43. 13, 14.) And he Å¿eems to Å¿peak it upon the account of the deliverance of his People; <hi>For your Å¿ake I have Å¿ent down to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38362:78"/>
brought down all their Nobles, and the</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, <hi>whoÅ¿e cry is in their Å¿hips.</hi> In every deliverance there is the excellent work of the Attributes of God; we may in Å¿uch a deliverance Å¿ay, Here is the Power of God, and here is the WiÅ¿dom of God, and here is the Love of God, and here is the FaithfulneÅ¿s of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as God in the confounding of the Languages at <hi>Babel,</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>Go too, let us go down,</hi> (as if he derected himÅ¿elf to his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, compaÅ¿Å¿ing about his glorious Throne) <hi>Come, let us go down.</hi> Gen. 11. 7. (Or, as Å¿ome take it of the Trinity, as in the Creation.) So when God Å¿ends us deliverances in our diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, he Å¿ets his Attributes at work; Go Power, go Mercy, go Love, go FaithfulneÅ¿s, go and act your reÅ¿pective parts in this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and muÅ¿t not this be then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and curious Piece that Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes bring forth? 3. They are great deliverances, if we conÅ¿ider the great Å¿ins and provocations they come over the heads of, the great unworthineÅ¿s of the receiver, heightens much the mercy and favour received; the reaÅ¿on why perÅ¿ons do not greaten their deliverances, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they do not greaten their Å¿ins, in the deep Å¿enÅ¿e and aggravations of them.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38362:78"/>
O Å¿uch a Soul would Å¿ay, as <hi>David, Is this the manner of men?</hi> O God, is not this a great deliverance for Å¿uch a great Å¿inner to receive? 4. They are great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, if we conÅ¿ider the time and Å¿eaÅ¿on of their coming in; as this deliverance of the Ships Company where <hi>Paul</hi> was, it was when all hope of being Å¿aved was taken away; and Å¿o were many of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances mentioned in this TreatiÅ¿e. So <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sea-deliverance, when he began to Å¿ink, ChriÅ¿t Å¿tretched forth his hand immediately; he was now Å¿inking and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Å¿ee how ready ChriÅ¿t was to Å¿ave; <hi>He Å¿tretched forth his hand and caught</hi> Peter, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30.) Our Å¿inking time, is JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿ts Å¿aving time. In the Mount is the Lord Å¿een; our extremity is Gods opportunity; and are not then theÅ¿e great deliverances never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? 5. They are great deliverances, if we conÅ¿ider they are not only deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Bodies, and Ships, and EÅ¿tates Å¿ometimes, but Souls; and where the Ship is loÅ¿t, and the EÅ¿tate is loÅ¿t, yet for the life to be Å¿aved, and the Soul deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a very great Deliverance; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve when a PriÅ¿oner is under the Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, is a great Mercy: O when God Reprieves a poor PriÅ¿oner,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38362:79"/>
this is Å¿ome Deliverance; we read o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it be Å¿uch a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had from a SickneÅ¿s at Shoar, <hi>Thou haÅ¿t delivered me in love to my Soul, and caÅ¿t all my Å¿ins behind thy back,</hi> (IÅ¿a. 38.) This is a double De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and Å¿ure Å¿uch Deliverances as theÅ¿e are worth Recording; TheÅ¿e are to be written in Marble and not in DuÅ¿t, with the Pen of Iron, (as the Prophet Å¿ays) and not with with point of a Diamond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Deliverances are wonderful, if you conÅ¿ider the many thouÅ¿ands that have periÅ¿hed in leÅ¿s Dangers to an eye of ReaÅ¿on; they are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and therefore wonderful hath God dealt with all men that go to Sea as with you. Hath not thouÅ¿ands periÅ¿hed by the Sword at Sea in bloody Engagements? MiÅ¿carried at Sea in dreadful and terrible Storms; Hath not the Sea been a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher for thouÅ¿ands? Are not there Millions of the Dead that the Sea muÅ¿t one day give up, and yet you Delivered, and yet you Å¿pared? O what diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy is this! And Å¿hall this be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten

How many that went out with you that never Returned? One taken, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other left; one Å¿unk, and another Å¿aved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Deliverances are Wonderful, if you conÅ¿ider the way that Å¿ometimes God takes to bring them about; O what Å¿trange ways doth God take to deliver, when he hath a mind to deliver; Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he brings down to the very Gate of the Grave, he brings to the Doors and Bars of the Sea, and then Å¿huts theÅ¿e doors; as <hi>Job</hi> Å¿peaks, He brings to the next door to periÅ¿hing, and then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers; <hi>MaÅ¿ter Å¿ave me, or I periÅ¿h;</hi> and then he lends an Arm, witneÅ¿s many of theÅ¿e deliverances here mentioned. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth it by Å¿trange means, low and contemptible, as the poor man that we Read of, that delivered the City, <hi>(EccleÅ¿.</hi> 9. 15.) Å¿ometimes by unthought of and unexpected means, as he that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> as this Story men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was a <hi>French</hi> Pyrate. As that Ship I have heard off, that when Å¿he Å¿prang a Leak, and they all had like to have periÅ¿hed, all on a Å¿udden the Leak Å¿topt, and they knew no ReaÅ¿on, but when they

came into the next Port to Å¿earch her, there was a great FiÅ¿h had wrought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf into the Leak, that they were glad to cut him out; was not here a miraculous deliverance? That <hi>Jonah</hi> Å¿hould be Å¿wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Whale, O what a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was this! and Å¿o he was preÅ¿erved! and how have Å¿ome been Å¿aved by Å¿udden Å¿hifts of Winds when near Å¿inking and periÅ¿hing? theÅ¿e are to be remembred to the Lord while you live: Oh! methinks this one Motive Å¿hould Å¿et on the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if I Å¿hould uÅ¿e no more, to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your Dangers and your Deliverances.</p>
               <p>But Å¿econdly, another Motive is this, to Remember your Dangers with your Deliverances; this will in your great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿treÅ¿Å¿es and extremities, contribute Å¿ome hope to you; to read over your RegiÅ¿ter, your ancient Records, how good God hath been at Å¿uch a time, and Å¿uch a time; how Å¿eaÅ¿onably he Å¿tept in and delivered in Å¿uch a Å¿trait and Å¿uch a Å¿trait; Oh then Å¿ays the Soul, why Å¿hould I deÅ¿pair, and caÅ¿t off all hope now? hath not he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and Å¿aved in Deaths often before now? for paÅ¿t experiences are good Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for Hope in preÅ¿ent exigencies and extremities; thus <hi>David</hi> argues, when at a great Å¿trait, <hi>Thou haÅ¿t delivered me, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38362:80"/>
wilt deliver me;</hi> and thus <hi>Paul, Thou haÅ¿t delivered me, and wilt deliver me. Haman</hi> found this a good way to Remember the years of the Lords right hand.</p>
               <p>3. Remember your Dangers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, for God Records them; they are filled up by God, and he will mind you of them another day if you forget them now; he keeps his Journals and Records; he hath his Book of Remembrance of your forgotten Mercies, as well as your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Å¿ins; God will one day read over all thoÅ¿e Deliverances you have forgotten; Oh poor Soul! did not I deliver thee in Å¿uch a Danger, in Å¿uch a DiÅ¿treÅ¿s, in Å¿uch a Death, when there was no Hope, when there was no Help, yet all this haÅ¿t thou forgotten; forgotten thy Mercy, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the God of thy Mercy; Oh! will not this Å¿ting you to the Heart, when God Å¿hall cauÅ¿e your Å¿trangled, and murdered Mercies to walk in your ConÅ¿ciences? when he Å¿hall give them a ReÅ¿urrection there?</p>

I will render praiÅ¿es unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 56 11. (and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) <hi>I will pay thee my Vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when I was in trouble,</hi> (PÅ¿al. 66. 13, 14.) But becauÅ¿e this is Å¿o ordinary to make Vows at Sea, and brake them a Shoar, let me enlarge a little upon it. 1. Why Å¿hould you forget your Vows after your Deliverances? They were not raÅ¿h Vows, there might have been Å¿ome excuÅ¿e, if you had made them raÅ¿hly, you might then have had a Plea, for Å¿aying it was an Error; but in times of diÅ¿treÅ¿s, men are Å¿erious, when Death and Eternity is Å¿et before them, and they upon the brink of another world; dare you Å¿inners raÅ¿hly Vow, in this day of your diÅ¿treÅ¿s; O no, your ConÅ¿ciences will bear witneÅ¿s againÅ¿t you, that you were in Å¿ober-Å¿ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s at that day. 2. Why Å¿hould you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38362:83"/>
forget your Vows after your Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for God will require payment? Nay, this is not only the ReaÅ¿on why we Å¿hould not forget to pay, but why we Å¿hould not delay to pay; <hi>When thou vows a vow to the Lord thy God, thou Å¿houldÅ¿t not Å¿lack to pay it, for the Lord thy God will require it, yea, will Å¿urely require it of thee, and is would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He will require it, Å¿o as to call to a payment day, he will demand it, he will Å¿end unto you a Summons to pay the Vows you made to him in the day of your DiÅ¿treÅ¿s. Oh! how often is ConÅ¿cience Gods Officer, that he Å¿ends to you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Payment? O Å¿ays ConÅ¿<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He will require it, Å¿o as to puniÅ¿h the non-payment; and Å¿o requiring is here taken, and in many other places, the Lord doth very often Å¿everely puniÅ¿h Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking; breaking of Vows doth cauÅ¿e God often to deÅ¿troy the works of your hands. Say not before the Angel, <hi>It was an error, wherefore Å¿hould God be angry at thy Vows, and deÅ¿troy the works of thy hands?</hi> (EccleÅ¿. 5. 4, 5.) Some ExpoÅ¿itors refer
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38362:84"/>
this to the PrieÅ¿t, before whom the Å¿in of raÅ¿h vows was to be confeÅ¿t; others carry it to ChriÅ¿t, the Angel of the Covenant. who Å¿ees through all our Å¿ubtil excuÅ¿es and equivocations, and puniÅ¿hes them. O, God is angry when men go Å¿o flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their Vows; O then God is angry, and deÅ¿troys the work of their hands, <hi>viz.</hi> diÅ¿appoints their endeavours, and denies them Å¿ucceÅ¿s.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, to forget your deliverances and dangers, is the greateÅ¿t ingratitude and unthankfulneÅ¿s in the world; hath God given you Å¿o many wonderful deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Å¿o many miraculous preÅ¿ervations, to be buried in the grave of oblivion? will you murder your mercies, and then bury them? It is commonly Å¿aid, Murder will out. Murdered Mercies will one day make terrible work, in walking in your ConÅ¿ciences.</p>
               <p>The next ObÅ¿ervation is this, That Salvations and Deliverances many times are not Å¿ent until perÅ¿ons be left helpleÅ¿s and hopeleÅ¿s. I Å¿hall give you a touch of this. Now all hope of being Å¿aved was taken away, no Å¿mall tempeÅ¿t lay upon them; now they were gulft in deÅ¿pair of ever coming off with their lives: Yet this often is the condition of Nations,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38362:84"/>
Ship-Companies, and PerÅ¿ons, where God intends to Å¿ave and deliver. The proofs of the laÅ¿t ObÅ¿ervation about Dangers and Deliverances being recorded and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, proves this alÅ¿o. Thus was <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the DiÅ¿ciples Å¿aved, when juÅ¿t at Å¿inking</p>
               <p>But why doth God Å¿tay Å¿o long before he Å¿ends deliverances and Å¿alvations? 1. BecauÅ¿e he delights to draw forth a Å¿pirit of prayer; if men will not pray when Å¿inking, when drowning, when dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they will never pray. O Å¿ee how <hi>Jonah</hi> prays in his diÅ¿treÅ¿s: <hi>And</hi> Jonah <hi>prayed to the Lord out of the FiÅ¿hes belly, and Å¿aid, I cried by reaÅ¿on of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of Hell cried I, and thou heardÅ¿t my voice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When my Soul fainted within me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Lord; and my Prayer came in unto thy holy Temple,</hi> (Jonah 2. 1, 2, 3, 7.) O Sirs, God loves prayer Å¿o well; that he Å¿tayes with his deliverances, that we might Å¿ue them out by prayer. <hi>Out of the Depths have I cried unto thee,</hi> Å¿aith <hi>David,</hi> (PÅ¿al. 130. 1.) Driven to it by deep and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleÅ¿s Å¿traits, into which I am plunged. And it Å¿eems to be an alluÅ¿ion to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, in their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es and dangers of being Å¿hipwrackt, crying unto the Lord. What will any man periÅ¿h, and never pray

HouÅ¿e, when he had Å¿o long been Å¿tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Fields, with his Husks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the Swine!</p>
               <p>4. BecauÅ¿e God will have all his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Deliverances look like his own hand and arm, his own arm brings Å¿alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him; he will have the print of his own hand upon it, that poor Å¿inners may Å¿ay, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, <hi>and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> Alas, Men would attribute it to themÅ¿elves, if Salvation did not come in Å¿uch a way, when all hope of being Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is taken away. Oh! every thing is beautiful in its Å¿eaÅ¿on; Is not Salvation and Deliverance now in Å¿eaÅ¿on? now they begin to deÅ¿pair, as to probable or viÅ¿ible hopes. O now God works like himÅ¿elf, now he appears in a deliverance to be God; which Å¿et the DiÅ¿ciples a wondring, <hi>What manner of Man is this, that the Winds and Sea obey him?</hi> Mark 4. 41. And at another time, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd his DiÅ¿ciples at Sea, and calmed the Winds, then they that were in the Ship worÅ¿hipped him, Å¿aying, <hi>Of a truth thou are the Son of God,</hi> Matth. 14. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>5. BecauÅ¿e he will by Å¿uch Å¿alvations Å¿et off his love to poor Souls: Was not the love of ChriÅ¿t Å¿et off highly, in taking
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38362:85"/>
that Å¿eaÅ¿on to Å¿ave the Ship when it was full; to Å¿ave them when they were fink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Is not that great Love, that Å¿teps forth to Å¿ave in an Extremity? O what Love was this, to Å¿ave this Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when all hope of being Å¿aved was taken away? Love always chuÅ¿es the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t times to appear and evidence it Å¿elf.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, BecauÅ¿e he will have his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, endearing deliverances to Souls. O how doth Å¿uch an appearance of God, at Å¿uch a time, endear the Soul of the Receiver. Therefore, Å¿aith <hi>David, I will love the Lord,</hi> (or love the Lord dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>my Rock and my Deliverer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to give you alÅ¿o a taÅ¿te of the Application, and not be large, becauÅ¿e I have been large upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which was mainly intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then learn we hence, that God may for gracious ends, known to himÅ¿elf, delay a mercy or a deliverance, and yet fully intends to give in that mercy. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> may wreÅ¿tle all night, and yet be put off; but in the break of day the mercy comes. The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> may cry to ChriÅ¿t for her Daughter, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent be put off, yet at laÅ¿t Å¿he Å¿hall carry it. The believing Soul may not have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38362:86"/>
the Dove come with an Olive-branch in her Mouth until Evening. ChriÅ¿t's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿ting of his love to poor Souls, is called his Supping with them; <hi>And I will Å¿up with you:</hi> Now Å¿upper comes not up till Evening.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Learn we hence, that God's timing our deliverances and Å¿alvations, is beÅ¿t for us; his time is the beÅ¿t time. Our time is always ready, (but Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) My <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ãâã</desc>
                  </gap> is not yet. If we had our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in our time, we Å¿hould not Å¿ee that beauty in them; for every thing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in its Å¿eaÅ¿on: and God chuÅ¿es the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t Å¿eaÅ¿ons to Å¿eud them, becauÅ¿e he will put a beauty upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn we hence, that no caÅ¿e is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿perate to God, though it be Å¿o to Man: One would have thought this a deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e, in Å¿uch a Storm, lightning the Ship, the caÅ¿ting out of the Tackling of the Ship, neither Sun nor Stars appeared, and all hope of being Å¿aved taken away; yet all this was but deÅ¿perate to them, it was not Å¿o to God: now their extremity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes God's opportunity, and he takes this juncture of time to appear in. Thus <hi>David,</hi> PÅ¿al. 42. 7, 8. all God's waves and God's billows had gone over him; a deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e! yet God (then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves)
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38362:86"/>
would command his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s in the day-time, and his Song Å¿hould be with him in the Night. Faith is an excellent Grace at a deÅ¿perate Å¿tand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn we hence, that God's thoughts are not as our thoughts; when we think of nothing but Å¿inking and periÅ¿hing, then doth God think of Å¿aving and delivering. They thought all hope of being Å¿aved was taken away, but God looks through the Storm and Cloud, and comforts them. As the DiÅ¿ciples, when they thought it had been a Spirit in their Storm that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; No, Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, <hi>be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; be of good chear, it is I,</hi> Mark 6. 50, 51, 52.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>Å¿e</hi> 2. Is it Å¿o, that the Å¿alvations and deliverances that many of us have, are not until we be brought to extremities? then it is a word of Exhortation; Then look up to God in the moÅ¿t deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e, when you know not what to do in your Storms at Sea, in your Straits at Land. O then let your eyes be up unto the Lord; you Å¿ee how many deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have come down in extremities, as anÅ¿wers to Prayer. O Pray hard; let go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sea, being in Storms at Sea, being brought to Extremities at Sea, learn you to Pray.</p>
